## IoT Dog Treat Dispensor

This project was to give the user the ability to call your dog over to the dispensor and give them a treat. It does have a live video feed as well. I used a Raspberry Pi 3 to accomplish this. I will update with photos. I'm not sure this is the final code, but it's what I had on my laptop at the time of creating this repo. There is some network setup as well that I'll create a document explaining how to do that.
